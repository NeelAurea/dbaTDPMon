This utility is a bespoke database / system maintenance, health-check and monitoring solution for SQL Server. It runs for versions from SQL Server 2000 until 2016. 
Some features are only available for SQL Server 2005 and beyond.
Utility consists in plain T-SQL code. A database is needed in order to store objects used by this utility.
Task automation is performed using SQL Agent jobs, pre-scheduled.
Maintenance-plan, health-check and monitoring modules can be used as “agentless” management system.

**Why dbaTDPMon?**
